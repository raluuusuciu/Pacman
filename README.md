## Getting started
Pacman enters a new world where the main goal is to eat all the hamburgers.  
The subgoal is doing that without being caught by the famous ghost.   
The game gives the user the possibility to register in a *database*.  
The players can try beat each other's score and reach the maximum number of points.  
Pacman sounds are included for a better experience.
